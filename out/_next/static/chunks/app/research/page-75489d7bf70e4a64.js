By analyzing clinical data from 120,000 RA patients, I have identified several potential risk factors for mortality in RA-ILD. I have also developed a "two-hit" inflammatory animal model for RA-ILD, which is currently under review for publication (ARD).'},{id:"siglec_5_fibrosis",title:"Siglec-5 and Pulmonary Fibrosis in RA",description:"Based on the animal model, I am investigating the pathogenesis of RA-ILD. My findings suggest that citrullination interferes with Siglec-5's recognition of sialic acid, promoting macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT) and exacerbating RA-ILD lung fibrosis. This research is supported by hospital and university grants."},{id:"tls_formation",title:"Tertiary Lymphoid Structure (TLS) Formation in RA-ILD",description:"Using single-cell transcriptomics, I discovered that B-cell and T-cell precursors in RA-ILD lung tissue, through secretion of chemokines and IL-6, induce the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), leading to lung tissue damage.
